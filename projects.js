    description:
    "The platform to be developed for Winegrid was quite challenging "+
    "as it encompassed a complex information architecture which generated a gap "+
    "with the user's mental model. In order to test and allow common ground of understanding "+
    "between the team members a hi-fi prototype was made in Adobe XD. "+
    "This made it easier to guess implementation efforts and the validity of some of the functionalities.",
    full_description: 
    "<h6> Product</h6>"+
    "<p>Watgrid's product, Winegrid, was a very interesting project "+
    "and I'm very glad I got to be part of it during my master's. "+
    "It is a groundbreaking technology, with a complex information architecture. "+
    "They develop and produce sensors to monitor wine production in real time, "+
    "alongside a SaaS platform to control their devices. "+
    "I was working as a UX designer, supporting the platform's development team.</p>"+

    "<br><h6>UX Challenges</h6>"+
    "<p>The fact that it was a company just popping out of start-up status, "+
    "meant there was still some distance between the engineer's mental model, "+
    "and that which would make sense for the final users. "+
    "Also, few of the engineers understood how to produce wine "+
    "and none of them how a full sized industrial production of wine works. "+
    "So it was necessary to understand the differences, "+
    "create a new mental model and reflect this on the platform itself. "+
    "For about a year this was a work in progress, as the platform was already up and running. "+
    "I studied, designed and developed, also as new features were being introduced "+
    "to the platform on a regular basis. Gladly, new investments were made that changed our game. </p>"+

    "<br><h6>Development Challenges</h6>"+
    "<p>Most notoriously, I designed and developed a selection element that faced a challenged, "+
    "and of which I am quite satisfied. The user needs to be able to select "+
    "the daily reading frequency of each sensor, but that can't be more that once every thirty minutes, "+
    "and it has to be in equal intervals throughout the day. These were technical constraints. "+
    "The user should also be able to select when the first read of the day was to happen. "+
    "In order to avoid explaining to the user all the necessary, and to avoid error, "+
    "it was necessary for the affordance of this element to enforce all of this, "+
    "and be clear at the same time. So a slider for the frequency was chosen, "+
    "alongside a scheduler that allowed to select the initial time and view all the "+
    "other consecutive schedule readings. To further ensure readability, "+
    "a clarifying human readable sentence was output dynamically with the selection. "+
    "This was developed in Angular and later translated into Jquery.</p>"+

    "<br><h6>Work in Graphical Design and Marketing</h6>"+
    "<p>Besides working as a UX Designer, I also supported the marketing team, "+
    "mostly with graphical design. The branding of the company was also not solidified, "+
    "so this was a challenging process as well. Most notoriously, "+
    "I designed a quick guide for users, in a single sheet of A4, "+
    "to go with every shipped device. It used only iconography, "+
    "so that translated versions were not necessary, and a QR Code directed for further clarifications, "+
    "although this was reported as not used. I also produced an instructional video and maintained the website's activity.</p>",

    full_description: 
      "<h6># Collaborative Economy</h6>"+
      "<p>The Collaborative Economy is a phenomenon of the recent decade, "+
      "where new and old habits of exchange were developed and re-discovered "+
      "in the digital realm. Most notoriously - new methods of creating value "+
      "collaboratively; making use of inert value and sharing goods, services "+
      "and even time - have created a new highly valued market, challenged policies, "+
      "and promoted a more sustainable way for people to face their daily challenges. "+
      "There are also companies that tag along with the promises of social, "+
      "economic and ecological sustainability, but fail to deliver and "+
      "end up just exploiting members of their digitally created communities "+
      "for their own gain.</p>"+
      
      "<br><h6># Time Banks</h6>"+
      "<p>In the meantime, there's an idea that has existed far before, "+
      "and that is used mostly for social rehabilitation and "+
      "economic self-reliance in smaller communities. We're talking about "+
      "time-banks, where people exchange their time, valuing everyone's "+
      "time equally. So an hour from a plumber is as valuable as an hour "+
      "from a tutoring mathematician. One would request a service "+
      "and \"pay\" the person in time-credits, equivalent to the time "+
      "spent in providing it. And this person will be able to exchange "+
      "similarly with other members.</p>"+
      
      "<br><h6># Time Banks in Portugal</h6>"+
      "<p>In Portugal, Time Banks have existed for a while and have a "+
      "few slightly specific rules. Each agency, consisting usually of "+
      "easily below 200 members, should validate each member upon joining, "+
      "through a personal interview. The agency also intermediates each "+
      "exchange, to promote that all members have an equal opportunity to "+
      "contribute. This network, in Portugal, has very little digital "+
      "support for their members and coordinators.</p>"+
      
      "<br><h6># A different definition of value</h6>"+
      "<p>This system is based on a marxist conception of value, of "+
      "which modern notions have undermined, and probably wouldn't be a "+
      "system sustainable on a large scale, although something similar "+
      "exists spanning through the United Kingdom. This system's value lies "+
      "in small communities, and ususally undermined groups of society, "+
      "strengthening social ties, their notion of self-worth, and overall "+
      "health of the individuals. </p>"+
      
      "<br><h6># Idea</h6>"+
      "<p>Contrasting the digital development of modern Collaborative "+
      "Economy platforms, with the actual social sustainability contribution "+
      "of Time banks in Portugal, this project took to study and develop "+
      "a prototype of a platform for Time Banks in Portugal, collaborating "+
      "with the agency of Santa Maria da Feira. This community was chosen "+
      "for being very dynamic and with a very stable organization, a strong "+
      "sense of belonging between members, and also, for the convenience of "+
      "proximity.</p>"+
      
      "<br><h6># Challenges</h6>"+
      "<p>One of the biggest challenges was lining up with how they value "+
      "this network. The value in belonging was not so much in obtaining "+
      "services and saving money, as one might expect, although a lot of "+
      "value could be obtained from here. Food, home maintenance services, "+
      "tutoring, transportation, dance/yoga/painting classes etc... The main "+
      "motivation was to be able to participate and underlyingly feel valued, "+
      "and most times even just to have company. This makes sense as most of "+
      "the more active members are retirees. This was possible to realize "+
      "through questionnaires and also visits to the community with conversations "+
      "over tea, getting to know if there was any community spirit, how "+
      "some of them joined, some particular situations, and how the agency "+
      "itself functions. The questionnaires aimed at understanding their "+
      "motivations, current use of technology and foreseable usage of a "+
      "digital platform for the Time Bank.</p>"+

      "<p>Another challenge was to establish the contribution that digital "+
      "technologies might have to help them with their main problem: there's "+
      "a higher tendency in members offering services than requiring them. "+
      "Two conclusions were obtained in regard to this issue. The literary "+
      "study established that changing the way their activity was framed by "+
      "their internal and external discourse would make a significant difference. "+
      "The empirical study established that a simple and familiar interface "+
      "to choose and \"purchase\" services would motivate members to request "+
      "more exchanges. </p>"+
      "<blockquote class='blockquote my-4 mx-5'>"+

      "I take a cab.\""+
      "<footer class='blockquote-footer'>a timebank participant*</footer>"+
      "</blockquote>"+
      
      "<br><h6># Prototypes</h6>"+
      "<p>Two prototypes were eventually developed and tested, with "+
      "different purposes. A first one in Wordpress to test the "+
      "technology's reliability, as the maintenance of the platform "+
      "should not require technical capacity. And a second on in Adobe XD "+
      "to validate an established design and proof of concept.</p>"+
      "<p>Results were certainly positive, and this project might still "+
      "come to fulfilled fruition.</p>"+
